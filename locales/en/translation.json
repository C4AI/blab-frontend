  "popupText": "The Blue Amazon is the maritime space that \"belongs\" to Brazil, i.e, the space that only Brazil can economically explore. It is demarcated counting 200 miles from the coast, along the entire coastline and the land area of the continental shelf. In addition, it includes the areas around oceanic islands. The name was given due to its gigantic size of approximately 3.5 million kmÂ² and its enormous biodiversity, thus, in comparison with the \"Green\" Amazon. In the blue Amazon, 95% of foreign trade circulates, 95% of the oil and 80% of the natural gas produced in the country are extracted, in addition to 45% of the fish produced.",
